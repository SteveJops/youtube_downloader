## Usage/Examples

There are two versions of code. First synchronic version is more stable and be less crushing but also slower as well(the difference is actually not huge).The second is asynchronic but more unstable, and can miss some videos due to not being able to download a video 'fore the next which is gonna be started downloading. The other instructions've already described in scripts to get more detailed instructions.
P.S.: The project has already had a chrome driver(v109) for selenium usage. If you need to us another version or another browser get it from https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/
